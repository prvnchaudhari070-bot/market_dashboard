# How to Fix the Login Issue

GitHub doesn't accept your regular password anymore (for security). You need a special "Token".

### Step 1: Get the "Magic Password" (Token)
1.  **[Click this link to generate a Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo&description=MarketDashboard)**
    *(You might need to sign in again).*
2.  Scroll to the very bottom of the page.
3.  Click the green **"Generate token"** button.
4.  **COPY the long code** that appears (it starts with `ghp_...`).
    *⚠️ Important: Copy it now, you won't see it again!*

### Step 2: Use it in Terminal
1.  Go back to your Terminal where it's stuck.
2.  **Username**: Type your GitHub username (`prvnchaudhari070-bot`) and press **Enter**.
3.  **Password**: **PASTE the long code** you copied.
    *⚠️ Note: You will NOT see anything moving or typing when you paste. It looks like it's frozen. That is normal!*
4.  Press **Enter**.

It should now upload your code! 🚀
